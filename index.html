	  <h3 align="justify">Command History</h3>
      <p align="justify">Attack Squadron 75 (VA-75) was first commissioned on 
        20 July 1943 as Bombing Squadron EIGHTEEN (VB-18) flying the Douglas SBD 
        &#8220;Dauntless&#8221; dive bomber. Following transition to the Curtiss 
        SB2C &#8220;Helldiver,&#8221; VB-18 embarked in USS INTREPID (CV 11) for 
        combat in the Pacific. The squadron flew numerous missions over the Philippines 
        and Okinawa, including the Battle of Leyte Gulf, 24-26 October 1944.</p>
      <p align="justify">Following World War II, the squadron transitioned to 
        the F4U &#8220;Corsair&#8221; and later to the AD-1 &#8220;Skyraider.&#8221; 
        Additionally, the squadron&#8217;s designation was changed to VA7A, then 
        to Attack Squadron 74, and finally to Attack Squadron 75 in 1950. In 1952, 
        Attack Squadron 75 entered combat in the Pacific Theater again embarked 
        in USS BON HOMME RICHARD (CV 31). The <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> 
        attacked hydroelectric and industrial complexes in North Korea and provided 
        close air support to troops in South Korea.</p>

      <p align="justify">September 1963 began a new era of naval aviation when 
        VA-75 became the first fleet squadron to fly the Grumman A-6A &#8220;Intruder.&#8221; 
        The Intruder was designed to carry the fight to the enemy in any weather 
        and following complete transition in early 1964, VA-75 began operating 
        the A-6A at sea in preparation for combat.</p>
      <p align="justify"> In 1965, the squadron deployed to the Western Pacific 
        in USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62) and introduced the Intruder to combat operations 
        in Southeast Asia. While in the Tonkin Gulf, the Punchers delivered over 
        two million pounds of ordnance on enemy targets. In 1968, VA-75 made its 
        second deployment to Vietnam in USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63). The squadron dropped 
        over 13 million pounds of ordnance on enemy targets, and set records for 
        the most missions and hours flown in combat by an A-6 squadron. For this 
        achievement, Attack Squadron 75 earned the Presidential Unit Citation.</p>
      <p align="justify"> The <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> made three deployments 
        to the Mediterranean Sea in USS SARATOGA (CV 60), earning the Battle &#8220;E&#8221; 
        and the Meritorious Unit Commendation. While scheduled for a May 1972 
        deployment as part of the Sixth Fleet, the &#8220;<strong>Sunday Punchers</strong>&#8221; 
        received 48 hours notice in early April to embark all aircraft in USS 
        SARATOGA (CV 60) for an emergency deployment. By May, VA-75 was again 
        flying combat missions against North Vietnam from the &#8220;Fighting 
        Cock&#8221; on Yankee Station.</p>

      <p align="justify">Operating in the Gulf of Tonkin through January 1973, 
        VA-75 repeatedly attacked North Vietnamese supply lines. The squadron&#8217;s 
        exemplary performance during Linebacker II operations in December 1972 
        helped to finally bring the Vietnam war to a close.</p>
      <p align="justify"> The <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> returned to NAS 
        Oceana in February 1973, and received the updated A-6E &#8220;Intruder.&#8221; 
        For the squadron&#8217;s superb performance in 1973, the Chief of Naval 
        Operations awarded the <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> the coveted RADM. 
        C. Wade McClusky award, recognizing VA-75 as the Navy&#8217;s most outstanding 
        attack squadron.</p>

      <p align="justify"> From September 1974 through 1980, VA-75 embarked for 
        five more deployments as part of the Sixth Fleet aboard USS SARATOGA (CV 
        60), participating in numerous exercises and responding to crises in the 
        Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Prior to the 1980 deployment, the <strong>Sunday 
        Punchers</strong> completed the transition to a more capable Intruder 
        variant, the A-6E TRAM.</p>
      <p align="justify"> In July 1981, VA-75 embarked in USS JOHN F. KENNEDY 
        (CV 67) and commenced preparations for an Indian Ocean deployment. During 
        the demanding training cycle, the <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> distinguished 
        themselves by winning the annual Intruder Bombing Derby and the prestigious 
        Hughes Trophy for operational and maintenance excellence.</p>
      <p align="justify"> In 1983, USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67) became the first 
        carrier to embark two A-6 squadrons instead of the usual complement of 
        one A-6 and two light attack squadrons. Attack Squadron 85 joined the 
        <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> and Carrier Air Wing THREE to provide 
        all-weather attack capabilities unprecedented in carrier aviation. The 
        1983-1984 deployment brought Attack Squadron 75 to the shores of Lebanon. 
        In December 1983 and again in February 1984, squadron aircraft engaged 
        in air strikes in support of multinational peacekeeping forces. The squadron 
        completed the seven-month deployment without mishap, flying over 3,900 
        hours. In November 1984, VA-75 rapidly responded to an emergency deployment 
        order to support anticipated contingency operations in the Eastern Mediterranean. 
        In six days, seven aircrews completed extensive night low-level training 
        and carrier qualifications, and were airlifted overseas with 80 technicians 
        to augment Attack Squadron 65 in USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69) for 
        three months.</p>

      <p align="justify"> During the 1986-1987 deployment in USS JOHN F. KENNEDY 
        (CV 67), VA-75 participated in NATO and bilateral exercises, spanning 
        the Mediterranean from Spain and Morocco to Turkey. The deployment was 
        extended due to alert contingencies, but completed with a perfect safety 
        record. Following the return to NAS Oceana, VA-75 became the first fleet 
        squadron to operated the latest and final Intruder variant, the A-6E SWIP 
        (System Weapons Integration Program). This version increased combat capabilities 
        by incorporating the Navy&#8217;s newest missiles and improving aircraft 
        reliability and survivability.</p>
      <p align="justify"> In August 1988, VA-75 set sail again for the Mediterranean 
        aboard USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67). Highlights of the deployment included 
        flights over seven different countries, 21 exercises, 11 port visits, 
        winning the 1988 Norden Pickle Barrel trophy for bombing excellence, and 
        earning the Secretary of the Navy&#8217;s Meritorious Unit Commendation 
        for superior performance. The squadron returned to NAS Oceana on 1 February 
        1989.</p>
      <p align="justify"> In 1990, the <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> embarked 
        in USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV 67) for eight and a half months. Following 
        three major fleet exercises and visits to New York City and Boston, the 
        squadron sped to the Red Sea for Operation Desert Shield.</p>

      <p align="justify">On 17 January 1991, Operation Desert Shield gave way 
        to Operation Desert Storm and the <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> led 
        the first naval air wing strike deep into Iraq. Over the next 43 days, 
        flying around the clock, the Puncher delivered over 1.6 million pounds 
        of ordnance, flew 2,150 combat hours in 498 sorties without a loss or 
        damage to any aircraft. For their efforts, the <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> 
        became the most decorated Navy squadron of Desert Storm.</p>
      <p align="justify">In October 1992, VA-75 again embarked in USS JOHN F. 
        KENNEDY (CV 67) for another deployment. While operating in the Mediterranean 
        Sea, the <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> excelled in multiple joint operations 
        with allied nations while maintaining full combat readiness in preparation 
        for possible operations in the Adriatic and Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p align="justify"> In October 1994 the <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> 
        deployed aboard USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69). Over the next six months, 
        VA-75 flew missions in support of Operation Southern Watch in Iraq, and 
        Operation Deny Flight in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After returning home in May 
        1995, VA-75 transferred to Carrier Air Wing SEVENTEEN (CVW-17) which deployed 
        with the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) in June 1996.</p>

      <p align="justify"> On 28 February 1997 in a ceremony at NAS Oceana, VA-75 
        was disestablished, marking the end of A-6 operations on the East Coast, 
        and the end of over a half century of service for the <strong>Sunday Punchers</strong> 
        in both war and peace. </p>
